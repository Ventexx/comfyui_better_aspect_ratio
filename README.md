This is a minor improvement to the existing aspect ratio node by [massao000](https://github.com/massao000/ComfyUI_aspect_ratios/tree/main).

## Changes

The main changes in this version include:

- **Addition of Two New Return Values:**  
  `width` and `height` are now added as return values.
  
- **Reordering of Inputs:**  
  The positions of `aspect_ratios` and `standard` inputs were adjusted for better intuitiveness compared to the original order.

## Usage

Since the changes are minimal, please refer to the [original documentation](https://github.com/massao000/ComfyUI_aspect_ratios/blob/main/README.md#Usage) for detailed instructions on using the node.
